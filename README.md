These are my personal files and assignments from the [Coursera Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) course by Stanford University.

## Notes

Each week has a `notes.md` file with my notes from watching the videos, completing assignments, and reading Andrew Ng's lecture slides. The files include math equations written in KaTeX, which does not render on Github, so I've also included PDFs of these files.
